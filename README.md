# NuCypher contracts

Contracts from the [main NuCypher codebase](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher) extracted into a separate repo for ease of testing and interoperability with other projects.

## Structure

* `deployment`: Deployment utilities
* `deployment/artifacts`: ABI and address of deployed contracts
* `contracts`: Source code for contracts
* `scripts`: Deployment and utilities scripts
* `tests`: Contract tests
* `src`: NPM package sources

## Installation

We use [Ape](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/index.html) as the testing and deployment framework of this project.

### Configuring Pre-commit

To install pre-commit locally:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Github Actions envvars

In future, we may need to set the following:

* `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Etherscan [API token](https://etherscan.io/apis), required to query source files from Etherscan.
* `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY`: Polygonscan [API token](https://polygonscan.com/apis), required to query source files from Polygonscan.
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token), required by [py-solc-x](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x) when querying installable solc versions.
* `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Infura project ID, required for connecting to Infura hosted nodes.

## Running the Tests

### Python Tests

This project uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to standardize the local and remote testing environments.
Note that `tox` will install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` automatically and run a linter (`black`); if that is not desirable, you can just run `py.test`.

### TypeScript Tests

To run the TypeScript tests, you will need to install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then you can run the tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```

## Deploy to Production

##### 1. Setup Deployment Parameters

Configurations for the deployments are in `deployments/constructor_params/<domain>/<filename>.yaml`.

Here is an example deployment configuration YAML file, but you can also find a full
examples in `deployments/constructor_params/lynx/`:

```yaml
deployment:
  name: example
  chain_id: <chain_id>

artifacts:
    dir: ./deployment/artifacts/
    filename: example.json

contracts:
  - MyToken:
      _totalSupplyOfTokens: 10000000000000000000000000
  - MyContractWithNoParameters
  - MyContractWithParameters:
      _token: $MyToken
      _number_parameter: 123456
      _list_parameter: [123456, 789012]
```

##### 2. Create Deployment Script

Deployment scripts are located in `scripts/<domain>/<name>.py`. 
Here is a simple example deployment script, but you can also find a full example in `scripts/lynx/deploy_root.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from ape import project

from deployment.constants import (
    CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMS_DIR,
)
from deployment.networks import is_local_network
from deployment.params import Deployer

VERIFY = not is_local_network()
CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMS_FILEPATH = CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMS_DIR / "my-domain" / "example.yml"


def main():
    deployer = Deployer.from_yaml(filepath=CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMS_FILEPATH,
                                  verify=VERIFY)
    token = deployer.deploy(project.MyToken)
    my_contract_with_no_parameters = deployer.deploy(
        project.MyContractWithNoParameters)
    my_contract_with_parameters = deployer.deploy(
        project.MyContractWithParameters)
    deployments = [
        token,
        my_contract_with_no_parameters,
        my_contract_with_parameters,
    ]
    deployer.finalize(deployments=deployments)
```

##### 3. Setup Deployment Account (production only)

In order to deploy to **production** you will need to import an account into ape:
```
$ ape accounts import <id>
```
You will be asked to input the private key, and to choose a password. The account will then be available as `<id>`.

Then you can check the account was imported correctly:
```
$ ape accounts list
```

##### 4. Deploy

Clear your ape database before deploying to production to avoid conflicts with upgradeable proxies.  
Please note that this will delete all ape deployment artifacts, so make sure you have a 
backup of artifacts from other projects before running this command.

```
$ rm -r ~/.ape/ethereum
```

Next, Run deployment scripts:
```bash

$ ape run <domain> <script_name> --network ethereum:local:test
$ ape run <domain> <script_name> --network polygon:mumbai:infura
$ ape run <domain> <script_name>  --network ethereum:goerli:infura
```

## NPM publishing process

For interoperability, we keep an NPM package with information of deployed smart contracts, such as address, ABI, etc.

The NPM package can be found in https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nucypher/nucypher-contracts and the process to update it is as follows:

1. Run the deployment scripts.

2. Change the `version` field of the `package.json`. See “Versioning” section.

3. Publish the new version:

```bash
  $ npm publish
```

### NPM versioning

We follow semantic versioning schema:

https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning

But with some changes: while the major version is 0, we always bump patch version instead of minor
version.
